This is a web application that enables users to rate a list of wines from Argentina based on their preferences. The wine list is retrieved from a MongoDB database that contains various types of wines from Argentina. The database is constantly updated with new wines, and the app provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to access the wine list.

Users can rate wines based on their personal preferences, such as the type of wine, the region it was produced in, and its flavor profile. When a user rates a wine, the app updates the rating in the database accordingly. This ensures that the wine list is always up-to-date and accurate, allowing users to make informed decisions about the wines they want to try.

In addition, the app provides detailed information about each wine, such as its origin, grape variety, and tasting notes, wineyard and year. Users can view this information by clicking on a wine in the list, which takes them to a page with more detailed information about the wine.

Overall, this app is a useful tool for anyone interested in exploring the world of Argentine wines. It provides a comprehensive and up-to-date list of wines, along with a simple and intuitive interface for rating and exploring them.
